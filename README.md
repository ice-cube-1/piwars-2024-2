<h1>Piwars 2024</h1>
Very boring, simple code for piwars entry
Does "escape route" and "lava palava" autonomously - everything else is manual<br/>
Also has a claw, LEDs and a kill switch - LEDs indicate mode, and claw is controllable in manual<br/><br/>

While this is most of a Piwars entry, I should probably emphasize that the entireity of this (excluding the electronics for the sensors) was done in <2 days, so I know it's simple for what's supposed to be a competition over a few months<br/>
Most of what's changed when tested is the tolerances in settings.py - also the sleeps in escape route<br/>
Anyway probably evident but none of this is tested yet so no idea how good it is (likely will be tested before I update this tbh)
